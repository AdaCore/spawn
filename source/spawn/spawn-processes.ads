   type Process is tagged limited private;
   --  The Process represents a running, exited, crashed or not-yet-running
   --  process.
   --
   --  The just created process has Not_Running status.
   --  In this status Program, Arguments, Environment, Working_Directory and
   --  Listener could be configured on the process. The Start call changes
   --  the process status to Starting. Since then no configuration allowed.
   --  If the OS is able to run corresponding program then the status becomes
   --  Running and Started, Standard_Input_Available events are triggered on
   --  the listener. Otherwise status becomes Not_Running and Error_Occurred
   --  event is signaled.
   --  A running process keeps Running state till it crashes or exit normally,
   --  then state becomes Not_Running and Finished event is triggered.
   --
   --  Note: Make sure to keep Process object alive while it has Running
   --  state. The suggested pattern is to keep it in the listener object.
   --  Finalization of the Process object in Running state result in wait
   --  for termination of the child process or undefined behavior.
   --
   --  The running process has standard output and standard error streams to
   --  read from and standard input stream to write. Corresponding events
   --  notify the listener when such calls are available.
